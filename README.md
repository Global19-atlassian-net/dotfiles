# dotfiles

*We shed as we pick up, like travelers who must carry everything in our arms,
and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind.*

My burgeoning collection of hacks and configs for Better Living (TM). Welcome to
my own little corner of the let's-all-share-our-dotfiles party.

## thanks

I decided to collect my dotfiles and publish them after reading Zach Holman's
[dotfiles are meant to be
forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

I have adapted my bash customizations to the structure given in
[Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)'
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) and extended his project
directory bash completion.
