## dotfiles

A day at the command prompt can save you an hour in the editor.

In that spirit, I have a small collection of configs and scripts that I have
hacked together in the course of work and daily life.

"dotfiles" is a catch-all term for system customizations, whether
configurations or scripts. (The name is from unix, which marks hidden files
by prepending a . to the name, such as the config files in a home directory).

## thanks

I decided to collect my dotfiles and publish them after reading Zach Holman's
[dotfiles are meant to be
forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

I have adapted my bash customizations to the structure given in
[Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)'
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) and extended his project
directory bash completion.
